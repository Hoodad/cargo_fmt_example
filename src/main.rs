/// ## Introduction
/// This text will be formatted by the cargo fmt when running, which is great and that helps a lot when you type and forget to break to a newline.
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// pub struct ImportantData {
///     // This text will however not be formatted to adhere to the max length of comments even tough it will end up on the doc page just like other comments.
///     some_field: u32,
/// }
/// ```

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
